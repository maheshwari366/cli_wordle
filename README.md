Wordle
===

A Wordle game that selects a 5-letter word at random and prompts the player to guess the word in 5 or fewer attempts. Given a guess, Wordle will provide feedback to the player for every letter in the guessed word:
* '\*': Letter is in the word, wrong position
* '-': Letter is not in the word
* Letter is in the correct position

The list of possible words is copied from https://copylists.com/words/list-of-5-letter-words#list_of_5_letter_words

To run the program, enter `python wordle.py` in the terminal and follow the prompts.
